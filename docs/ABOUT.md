C# is a multiparadigm language with lots of features. While at its core it's still an object oriented language that's modeled after Java it supports first class functions, SQL-like syntax to access containers, automatic getters and setters, pattern matching, direct memory access in an otherwise garbage collected environment, statically typed, dynamically typed and (to a certain degree) type inferred programming and many other features in a constantly growing feature set.

C# is typically compiled to Microsoft's IL code, which means that it can interact seamlessly with other such languages like F#, Visual Basic or derivates of otherwise non-IL-compatible languages (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_CLI_languages).

That IL code is run in a virtual machine, and while the default implementation by Microsoft (the ".NET framework runtime") is supplied for Windows only, the open source [Mono project](http://www.mono-project.com/) and the new [.NET Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core) project by Microsoft allow C# to be used on other platforms like MacOS or Unix-based systems.
