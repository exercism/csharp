C# is a modern, object oriented language developed and maintained by Microsoft. The learning curve is small, reduced even if the developer has experience with other 'C-Style' languages.

C# is a carefully designed language with lots of great features, such as type-inference and async/await. The official [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) is very extensive and well-written.

Although .NET used to be Windows-only, with the release of [.NET Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core) you can also use C# on Mac or Unix-based systems.
