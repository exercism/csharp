### Windows
All tests have been ignored except the first one for you to work on. To continue, just remove the ```[Ignore]``` attribute on the test to start working on it.

Make sure [NUnit](http://nunit.org/?p=download) version 3.x is installed, if not already installed from the setup from above.

This installation should include the NUnit-Gui executable. Run this and, after compiling, open the assembly from the Gui and you are able to run the tests.

**Note:** You may need to include the nunit-framework.dll in the same directory as the source code you're compiling if you get an error saying it can't find the ```nunit.framework.dll```.

If you installed the NUnit runner through NuGet, the runner will be located in the ```\packages\NUnit.Console(version number)\tools``` folder where your project is.

If you installed NUnit manually the runner will be in the ```Program Files (x86)\NUnit(version number)\bin``` folder.

Once you have been able to compile the code it will create a DLL in the ```\bin\Debug``` folder of your project. In the NUnit runner, select "Open Project" and select the DLL that was created from compiling. This will load all the tests and allow you to run them.

The NUnit runner will automatically reload the DLL if it has been updated.

### Mac
Xamarin Studio also ships with NUnit. Right-click the solution you created before and choose *Add New Project*.

Then from the new project dialog, just select an NUnit class library.

From here you can write NUnit tests right away. To run the tests open the `Unit Tests` pad within
Xamarin (View -> Pads -> Unit Tests).
