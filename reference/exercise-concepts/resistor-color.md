# Concepts of Resistor Color

[Example implementation](https://exercism.org/tracks/csharp/exercises/resistor-color/solutions)

## General

- functions: used as the main entry point for the exercise
- static function: the static keyword is the modifier that makes the method static, and enables it to be called without instantiation. The static method can access the variables passed in as arguments, global, and only other static members of the class.
- function arguments: input color is passed as an argument
- return values: returning a value from a method
- exceptions: throw an exception in the event of invalid/null input
- scoping: use `{` and `}` to denote scoping
- classes: the tested method is defined in a class
- objects: creating an object to keep list of colors
- visibility: making tested method and tested class `public`
- imports: import types through `using` statements
- namespaces: knowing where to find the `Array` class
- expression body method: it makes the code cleaner for a short (one-line) method
- immutability: defining the colors in an array as `readonly`
- string: array elements defined as string
- array: creating an array to hold list of colors
- static method: to access metods at the type level.
- int: return sign integers
