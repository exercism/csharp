# Concepts of Gigasecond

[Example implementation](https://exercism.io/tracks/csharp/exercises/gigasecond/solutions)

## General

- functions: used as the main entry point for the exercise
- static function: the static keyword is the modifier that makes the method static, and enables it to be called without instantiation. The static method can access the variables passed in as arguments, global, and only other static members of the class.
- function arguments: input 'moment' is passed as an arguments
- return values: returning a value from a method
- scoping: use `{` and `}` to denote scoping
- type inference: using `var` to define the seconds
- classes: the tested method is defined in a class
- visibility: making tested method and tested class `public`
- imports: import types through `using` statements
- namespaces: knowing where to find the `DateTime` class
- expression body method: it makes the code cleaner for a short (one-line) method
- Exponential (scientific): use to represent numbers e.g 1e9 to represent 1000000000
- static method: to access metods at the type level.
- DateTime: Represents a date and time of a day.
