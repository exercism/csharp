# Concepts of grade-school

[Example implementation](https://exercism.org/tracks/csharp/exercises/grade-school/solutions/2fd52e1bbfcecdfaff4075c4)

## General

- functions: used as the main entry point for the exercise
- function arguments: student name and grade is passed as an input argument
- return values: returning a value from a method
- scoping: use `{` and `}` to denote scoping
- interfaces: the type returned is an `IEnumerable<string>`
- classes: the tested method is defined in a class
- objects: creating an instance of the `SortedList<string, int>` class
- state: keeping track of the grades
- visibility: making tested method and tested class `public`
- imports: import types through `using` statements
- namespaces: knowing where to find the `SortedList<string, int>` class
- assignment: assigning values, such as the dictionary
- mutation: mutating the sorted list after it has been created
- mapping, selecting, ordering enumerables: using multiple LINQ methods to manipulate enumerables (`Where`, `OrderBy`, `Select`, `ToArray`)
- strings: a `string` is used for a student
- integers: an `int` is used for a grade
- dictionaries: a `SortedList<string, int>` is used as to store the student to grade mapping
- equality operator: `==`
