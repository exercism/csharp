# Topics Falling Outside of the Scope of Exercism's C# Track

This document provides examples of material that falls outside of
Exercism's scope. It indicates the limits of what can be
directly taught by the exercises.

The document should answer the question
"Is topic or skill x covered by Exercism?".

The material should be capable of being communicated to an enquiring
student as and when required.

Where material is covered under "Out of scope" in _design.md_
for a particular exercise it should not be repeated here
unless it is felt that the topic otherwise has insufficient prominence.
