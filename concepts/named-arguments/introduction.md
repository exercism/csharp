# Introduction

So far we have seen that the arguments passed into a method are matched to the method are matched to the method's declared parameters based on position. An alternative approach, particularly where a routine takes a large number of arguments, the caller can match arguments by specifying the declared parameter's identifier.

The following illustrates the syntax:

```csharp
class Card
{
    static string NewYear(int year, int month, int day)
    {
        return $"Happy {year}-{month}-{day}!";
    }
}

Card.NewYear(month: 1, day: 1, year: 2020);  // => "Happy 2020-1-1!"
```
