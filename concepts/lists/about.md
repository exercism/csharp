# About

Lists in C# are collections of primitive values or instances of structs or classes. They are implemented in the base class library as [`List<T>`][lists-docs] where `T` is the type of the item in the list. The API exposes a rich set of methods for creating and manipulating lists.

```csharp
var listOfStrings = new List<string>();
var listOfIntegers = new List<int>();
var listOfRandoms = new List<Random>();
var listOfBigIntegers = new List<BigInteger>();
```

A collection definition typically includes a place holder in angle brackets, often `T` by convention. This allows the collection user to specify what type of items to store in the collection.

Unlike arrays (TODO cross-ref-tba) lists can resize themselves dynamically.

## LINQ

Although the built-in API of `List<T>` is rich (including mappings and filters such as `ConvertAll`, `FindAll` and `Foreach`) and its [looping syntax][for-each] is very clear, and you definitely need to be familiar with this API, Language Integrated Query ([LINQ][linq]) is available for many tasks, is even more powerful and widely used and has the advantage of providing a consistent interface across library collections, third-party collections and your own classes. See (TODO cross-ref-tba).
