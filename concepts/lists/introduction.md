# Introduction

Lists in C# are collections of primitive values or instances of structs or classes. They are implemented in the base class library as `List<T>` where `T` is the type of the item in the list. The API exposes a rich set of methods for creating and manipulating lists.

Items can be added to and removed from lists. They grow and shrink as necessary.

```csharp
var listOfStrings = new List<string>();
```
