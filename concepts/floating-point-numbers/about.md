# About

There are three floating-point types in C#: `double`, `float` and `decimal`. The most commonly used type is `double`, whereas `decimal` is normally used when working with monetary data. A `double` is written as `2.45` or `2.45d`, a `float` as `2.45f` and a decimal as `2.45m`.

Each floating-point type has its own [precision, approximate range and size][docs-microsoft.com-characteristics-of-the-floating-point-types].

Some conversions between floating point types are [automatic (implicit)][docs-microsoft.com-implicit-numeric-conversion], but others are [manual (explicit)][docs-microsoft.com-explicit-numeric-conversion].

```csharp
decimal account = 125m * (decimal)1.2f;
```

Always be careful when checking the values of floating-point types for equality, as values that can appear to represent the same value could actually be different. See [this article][docs.microsoft.com_precision-in-comparisons] for more information.

You can find a short introduction to floating-point numbers at [0.30000000000000004.com][0.30000000000000004.com]. The [Float Toy page][evanw.github.io-float-toy] has a nice, graphical explanation how a floating-point numbers' bits are converted to an actual floating-point value.
