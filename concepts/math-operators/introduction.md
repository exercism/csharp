# Introduction

C# has built-in operators for the usual math operations:

- `+`: addition
- `-` subtraction
- `/`: division
- `*`: multiplication
- `%`: remainder

There are also two special operators:

- `++`: increment
- `--`: decrement

These operators add respectively subtract one from a value.
