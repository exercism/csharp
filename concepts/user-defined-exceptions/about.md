# About

A user-defined exception is any class defined in your code that is derived from `System.Exception`. It is subject to all the rules of class inheritance but in addition the compiler and language runtime treat such classes in a special way allowing their instances to be thrown and caught outside the normal control flow as discussed in the `exceptions` exercise. User-defined exceptions can be used in every way like runtime and Microsoft Base Class Library exceptions.

This special treatment applies only to `Exception`-derived classes. You cannot throw instances of any other type.

User-defined exceptions are often used to carry extra information such as a message and other relevant data to be made available to the catching routines. This can then be recorded in logs, reported to a user or perhaps used in a retry operation. `System.Exception` has convenient data members and appropriate constructors to hold a message and the "inner" exception.

By convention exception class names end with "Exception", e.g. `MyTerribleException`.

Whilst using user-defined exceptions to wrap and enhance third party exceptions is a frequently seen pattern, the general advice is not to use them outside of this use case too liberally in your own code. It is considered an anti-pattern. There are challenges to this view and you can see both sides of the argument in this [Stack Exchange post][se-exceptions].

This [article][create-user-defined-exceptions] is a good introduction to user-defined exceptions.

As part of their guidance on [creating and throwing exceptions][exceptions-guidance] the .NET team recommend that user defined exceptions have a number of [convenience constructors][convenience-constructors]. For most purposes the combination illustrated below is appropriate.

```csharp
public class IncompleteExerciseException : System.Exception
{
    public IncompleteExerciseException() : base() { }
    public IncompleteExerciseException(string message) : base(message) { }
    public IncompleteExerciseException(string message, System.Exception inner) : base(message, inner) { }
}
```
