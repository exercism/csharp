# About

[concept:csharp/enumerables]() can be iterated over using a [`foreach` loop][foreach-statement]:

```csharp
char[] vowels = new [] { 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' };

foreach (char vowel in vowels)
{
    // Output the vowel
    System.Console.Write(vowel);
}

// => aeiou
```

A `foreach` loop consists of three parts:

1. The declaration: define the variable that will contain the iterated value. This variable can (only) be used inside the loop.
2. The iterable object: the object that can be iterated over.
3. The loop body.

## for vs foreach loops

However, generally a `foreach` loop is preferrable over a `for` loop for the following reasons:

- A `foreach` loop is guaranteed to iterate over _all_ values. With a `for` loop, it is easy to miss elements, for example due to an off-by-one error.
- A `foreach` loop is more _declarative_, your code is communicating _what_ you want it to do, instead of a `for` loop that communicates _how_ you want to do it.
- A `foreach` loop is foolproof, whereas with `for` loops it is easy to have an off-by-one error.
- A `foreach` loop works on all collection types, including those that don't support using an indexer to access elements.

To guarantee that a `foreach` loop will iterate over _all_ values, the compiler will not allow updating of a collection within a `foreach` loop:

```csharp
char[] vowels = new [] { 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' };

foreach (char vowel in vowels)
{
    // This would result in a compiler error
    // vowel = 'Y';
}
```

A `for` loop does have some advantages over a `foreach` loop:

- You can start or stop at the index you want.
- You can use any (boolean) termination condition you want.
- You can skip elements by customizing the incrementing of the loop variable.
- You can process collections from back to front by counting down.
- You can use `for` loops in scenarios that don't involve collections.

Related Topics:

- You should be aware that C# supports [multi-dimensional arrays][multi-dimensional-arrays] like `int[,] arr = new int[10, 5]` which can be very useful.
- You should also be aware that you can instantiate objects of type [`System.Array`][system-array-object] with `Array.CreateInstance`. Such objects are of little use - mainly for interop with VB.NET code. They are not interchangeable with standard arrays (`T[]`). They can have a non-zero lower bound.

Both the above topics are discussed more fully in a later exercise.
