## Running the tests

To run the tests, run the command `dotnet test` from within the exercise directory.

Most of the tests provided in the C# track's exercises have a `Skip` property set on them.
Once you get the first test passing, remove the `Skip` from another test and get it passing.
Once none of the tests are skipped and they are all passing, you can submit your solution 
using `exercism submit {{ .Spec.Name }}.cs`

## Further information
