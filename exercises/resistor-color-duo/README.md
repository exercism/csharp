# Resistor Color Duo

If you want to build something using a Raspberry Pi, you'll probably use _resistors_. For this exercise, you need to know two things about them:

* Each resistor has a resistance value.
* Resistors are small - so small in fact that if you printed the resistance value on them, it would be hard to read.
To get around this problem, manufacturers print color-coded bands onto the resistors to denote their resistance values. Each band has a position and a numeric value. For example, if they printed a brown band (value 1) followed by a green band (value 5), it would translate to the number 15.

In this exercise you are going to create a helpful program so that you don't have to remember the values of the bands. The program will take color names as input and output a two digit number, even if the input is more than two colors!


The band colors are encoded as follows:

- Black: 0
- Brown: 1
- Red: 2
- Orange: 3
- Yellow: 4
- Green: 5
- Blue: 6
- Violet: 7
- Grey: 8
- White: 9

From the example above:
brown-green should return 15
brown-green-violet should return 15 too, ignoring the third color.


## Running the tests

To run the tests, run the command `dotnet test` from within the exercise directory.

Initially, only the first test will be enabled. This is to encourage you to solve the exercise one step at a time.
Once you get the first test passing, remove the `Skip` property from the next test and work on getting that test passing.
Once none of the tests are skipped and they are all passing, you can submit your solution 
using `exercism submit ResistorColorDuo.cs`
