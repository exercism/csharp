## Hints
This exercise requires you to process a collection of data. You can simplify your code by using lazy sequences to improve performance.
For more information, see [this page](https://xosfaere.wordpress.com/2010/03/21/lazy-evaluation-in-csharp/).


## Running the tests

To run the tests, run the command `dotnet test` from within the exercise directory.

Initially, only the first test will be enabled. This is to encourage you to solve the exercise one step at a time.
Once you get the first test passing, remove the `Skip` property from the next test and work on getting that test passing.
Once none of the tests are skipped and they are all passing, you can submit your solution 
using `exercism submit ZebraPuzzle.cs`
