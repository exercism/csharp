# Spiral Matrix

Given the size, return a square matrix of numbers in spiral order.

The matrix should be filled with natural numbers, starting from 1
in the top-left corner, increasing in an inward, clockwise spiral order,
like these examples:

##### Spiral matrix of size 3

```plain
1 2 3
8 9 4
7 6 5
```

##### Spiral matrix of size 4

```plain
 1  2  3 4
12 13 14 5
11 16 15 6
10  9  8 7
```

### Submitting Exercises

Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure the exercise file that you're submitting is in the `exercism/csharp/<exerciseName>` directory.

For example, if you're submitting `bob.cs` for the Bob exercise, the submit command would be something like `exercism submit <path_to_exercism_dir>/csharp/bob/bob.cs`.
