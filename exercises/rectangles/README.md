# Rectangles

Count the rectangles in an ASCII diagram like the one below.

```
   +--+
  ++  |
+-++--+
|  |  |
+--+--+
```

The above diagram contains 6 rectangles:

```


+-----+
|     |
+-----+
```

```
   +--+
   |  |
   |  |
   |  |
   +--+
```

```
   +--+
   |  |
   +--+


```

```
       
       
   +--+
   |  |
   +--+
```

```
       
       
+--+
|  |
+--+
```

```
       
  ++   
  ++   
       
       
```

You may assume that the input is always a proper rectangle (i.e. the length of
every line equals the length of the first line).

### Submitting Exercises

Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure the exercise file that you're submitting is in the `exercism/csharp/<exerciseName>` directory.

For example, if you're submitting `bob.cs` for the Bob exercise, the submit command would be something like `exercism submit <path_to_exercism_dir>/csharp/bob/bob.cs`.

## Submitting Incomplete Solutions
It's possible to submit an incomplete solution so you can see how others have completed the exercise.
