# Custom Set

Create a custom set type.

Sometimes it is necessary to define a custom data structure of some
type, like a set. In this exercise you will define your own set. How it
works internally doesn't matter, as long as it behaves like a set of
unique elements.

## Hints

This exercise requires you to create custom equality comparison logic.
For more information, see [this page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.object.equals?view=netcore-2.0#System_Object_Equals_System_Object_).


## Running the tests

To run the tests, run the command `dotnet test` from within the exercise directory.

Initially, only the first test will be enabled. This is to encourage you to solve the exercise one step at a time.
Once you get the first test passing, remove the `Skip` property from the next test and work on getting that test passing.
Once none of the tests are skipped and they are all passing, you can submit your solution 
using `exercism submit CustomSet.cs`
