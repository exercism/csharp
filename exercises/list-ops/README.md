# List Ops

Implement basic list operations.

In functional languages list operations like `length`, `map`, and
`reduce` are very common. Implement a series of basic list operations,
without using existing functions.

## Hints
The `Foldl` and `Foldr` methods are "fold" functions, which is a concept well-known in the functional programming world, but less so in the object-oriented one. If you'd like more background information, check out this [fold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fold_(higher-order_function)) page.
