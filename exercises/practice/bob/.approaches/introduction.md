# Introduction

There are various idiomatic approaches to solve Bob.
A basic approach can use a series of `if` statements to test the conditions.
Or a [switch][switch] on a [tuple][tuple] of the conditions can be used.
An array can contain answers from which the right response is selected by an index calculated from scores given to the conditions.

## General guidance

Regardless of the approach used, some things you could look out for include

- If the input is trimmed, [Trim][trim] only once.

- Use the [EndsWith][endswith] `String` method instead of checking the last character by index for `?`.

- Don't copy/paste the logic for determining a shout and for determing a question into determing a shouted question.
  Combine the two determinations instead of copying them.
  Not duplicating the code will keep the code [DRY][dry].

- Perhaps consider making `IsQuestion` and `IsShout` values set once instead of functions that are possibly called twice.

- If an `if` statement can return, then an `else if` or `else` is not needed.
  Execution will either return or will continue to the next statement anyway.

- If the body of an `if` statement is only one line, curly braces aren't needed.
  Some teams may still require them in their style guidelines, though.

## Approach: `if` statements

```csharp
public static string Response(string message)
{
    if (IsSilence(message))
        return "Fine. Be that way!";

    if (IsYell(message) && IsQuestion(message))
        return "Calm down, I know what I'm doing!";

    if (IsYell(message))
        return "Whoa, chill out!";

    if (IsQuestion(message))
        return "Sure.";

    return "Whatever.";
}

private bool IsSilence(string message)
{
    return string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(message);
}

private bool IsYell(string message)
{
    return message.Any(char.IsLetter) && message.ToUpperInvariant() == message;
}

private bool IsQuestion(string message)
{
    return message.TrimEnd().EndsWith("?");
}
```

For more information, check the [`if` statements approach][approach-if].

## Approach: `switch` on a `tuple`

```csharp
private static bool IsShout(string input) => input.Any(c => char.IsLetter(c)) && input.ToUpper() == input;

public static string Response(string statement)
{
    var input = statement.TrimEnd();
    if (input == "")
        return "Fine. Be that way!";

    switch ((input.EndsWith('?'), IsShout(input)))
    {
        case (true, true): return "Calm down, I know what I'm doing!";
        case (_, true): return "Whoa, chill out!";
        case (true, _): return "Sure.";
        default: return "Whatever.";
    }
}
```

## Other approaches

Besides the aforementioned, idiomatic approaches, you could also approach the exercise as follows:

### Other approach: answer array

An array can be defined that contains Bobâ€™s answers, and each condition is given a score.
The correct answer is selected from the array by using the score as the array index.
For more information, check the [Answer array approach][approach-answer-array].

### Other approach: regular expressions

Regular expressions can be constructed to classify Bob's answers.
For more information, check the [regular expressions approach][approach-regular-expressions].

## Which approach to use?

Which to use is pretty much a matter of personal preference.
