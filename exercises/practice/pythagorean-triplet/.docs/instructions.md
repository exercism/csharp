A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for
which,

```text
a² + b² = c²
```

For example,

```text 
3² + 4² = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5².
```

Given an input integer N, find the set of Pythagorean triplets that satisfies `a + b + c = N`.

For instance, with N = 1000, there is exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which `a + b + c = 1000`: `{a = 200, b = 375, c = 425}`.
