# Performance

In this approach, we'll find out how to most efficiently reverse a string in C#.

The [approaches page][approaches] lists three idiomatic approaches to this exercise:

1. [Using LINQ][approach-linq]
2. [Using `Array.Reverse()`][approach-array-reverse]
3. [Using `StringBuilder`][approach-string-builder]

For our performance investigation, we'll also include a fourth approach that [uses `Span<T>`][approach-span].

## Benchmarks

To benchmark these approaches, we wrote a [small benchmark application][benchmark-application] using [BenchmarkDotNet library][benchmark-dotnet].
The benchmark checks the various approaches against strings of length `0`, `10`, `100` and `100_000`.
Besides the regular CPU-time columns, the amount of memory used was also tracked.

These are the results:

The final rankings are:

1. [Using `Span<T>`][approach-span]
2. [Using `Array.Reverse()`][approach-array-reverse]
3. [Using `StringBuilder`][approach-string-builder]
4. [Using LINQ][approach-linq]

### Span&lt;T&gt;

The top performing approach is the `Span<T>` approach.
This is due to us allocating the `char []` on the stack and not on the heap.
Stack access is both faster than heap access and does not require garbage collection.

The main downside is that the stack has a relatively small amount of memory, so for very large strings you'll get a `StackOverflowException`.

### Array.Reverse

The `Array.Reverse()` call has very similar performance characteristics to the `Span<T>` approach.
This is not coincidental, as `Array.Reverse()` actually [uses `Span<T>` internally][src-array-reverse]:

```csharp
case CorElementType.ELEMENT_TYPE_CHAR:
    UnsafeArrayAsSpan<short>(array, adjustedIndex, length).Reverse();
    return;
```

The main reason why it is slower than the `Span<T>` approach, is that the `ToCharArray()` call [allocates a `char[]` on the heap][src-to-char-array], which is slower to access and needs to be garbage collected:

```csharp
char[] chars = new char[Length];
```

### LINQ

The LINQ-based approach is the slowest _and_ allocates the most memory.
In general, LINQ makes for highly readable code, but is usually not the most performance.

### StringBuilder

The `StringBuilder` approach is slightly better, but still quite a bit slower than the two top-performing approaches.
It also allocates the most memory of all the approaches.

One common way to optimize performance when using a `StringBuilder` is to set its internal buffer's capacity to a value that won't be exceeded:

```csharp
var chars = new StringBuilder(capacity: input.Length);
```

Unfortunately, in this case this does not give us any performance benefit:

|                Method | Length |     Mean |    Error |   StdDev |   Gen0 | Allocated |
| --------------------: | -----: | -------: | -------: | -------: | -----: | --------: |
|         StringBuilder |      0 | 13.00 ns | 0.311 ns | 0.635 ns | 0.0080 |     104 B |
| StringBuilderCapacity |      0 | 15.18 ns | 0.354 ns | 0.664 ns | 0.0080 |     104 B |
|         StringBuilder |     10 | 13.75 ns | 0.323 ns | 0.331 ns | 0.0080 |     104 B |
| StringBuilderCapacity |     10 | 15.28 ns | 0.354 ns | 0.508 ns | 0.0080 |     104 B |
|         StringBuilder |    100 | 13.00 ns | 0.307 ns | 0.545 ns | 0.0080 |     104 B |
| StringBuilderCapacity |    100 | 15.13 ns | 0.352 ns | 0.844 ns | 0.0080 |     104 B |
|         StringBuilder | 100000 | 13.25 ns | 0.311 ns | 0.656 ns | 0.0080 |     104 B |
| StringBuilderCapacity | 100000 | 14.99 ns | 0.345 ns | 0.631 ns | 0.0080 |     104 B |

## Conclusion

The top performing approaches are the `Span<T>` and `Array.Reverse()` approaches.
The `Span<T>` approach has the downside of being more error-prone to write and from not working for all inputs, but it is the fastest approach. üèÜ

The two slowest approaches, LINQ and `StringBuilder`, are also the ones that allocate (the most) memory.

```exercism/note
Reducing memory allocation is often a great way to improve performance.
