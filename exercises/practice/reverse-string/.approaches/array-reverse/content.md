# Array.Reverse

```csharp
using System;

public static class ReverseString
{
    public static string Reverse(string input)
    {
        var chars = input.ToCharArray();
        Array.Reverse(chars);
        return new string(chars);
    }
}
```

The `string` class' [`ToCharArray()`][to-char-array] method returns the string's characters as a `char[]`.

~~~~exercism/caution
The `char[]` returned by `ToCharArray()` is a **copy** of the `string`'s characters.
Modifying the values in the `char[]` does **not** update the `string` it was created from.
~~~~

We then pass the `char[]` to the [`Array.Reverse()`][array-reverse] method, which will reverse the array's content _in-place_ (meaning the argument is modified).

Finally, we return the reversed `string` by calling its constructor with the (reversed) `char[]`.
