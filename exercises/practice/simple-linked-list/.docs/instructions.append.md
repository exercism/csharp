# Instruction append

This exercise requires you to create a linked list data structure which can be iterated. 

1. Implement the `Count` property - it should not be possible to change its value from the outside
2. Implement the `Push(T value)` method that adds a value to the list at its head. 
3. Implement the `Pop()` method which removes and returns a value from the head. 
4. Add a constructor to allow initialisation with a single value, or with an interable
5. Implement the `IEnumerable<T>` interface. For more information, see [this page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.ienumerable-1).
6. Ensure `Reverse()` method is available.
