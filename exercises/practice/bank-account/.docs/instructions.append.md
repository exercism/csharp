# Hints

This exercise requires you to handle data related to currency and money. A normal approuch is to use the [Decimal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.decimal?view=net-6.0) struct to store currency values.
Note though that you then only store the numeric value of a currency.
