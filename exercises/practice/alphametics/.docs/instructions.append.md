# Hints

- To parse the text, you could try to use the [Sprache](https://github.com/sprache/Sprache/blob/develop/README.md) library. You can also find a good tutorial [here](https://www.thomaslevesque.com/2017/02/23/easy-text-parsing-in-c-with-sprache/).
- You can solve this exercise with a brute force algorithm, but this will possibly have a poor runtime performance.
  Try to find a more sophisticated solution.
- Hint: You could try the column-wise addition algorithm that is usually taught in school.
