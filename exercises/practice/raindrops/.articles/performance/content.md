# Performance

In this approach, we'll find out how to most efficiently calculate Raindrops in C#.

The [approaches page][approaches] lists two idiomatic approaches to this exercise:

1. [Using if statements][approach-if-statements]
2. [Using the Aggregate method][approach-aggregate]

## Benchmarks

To benchmark the approaches, we wrote a [small benchmark application][benchmark-application] using [BenchmarkDotNet library][benchmark-dotnet].

The `if` statements approach was tried using concatenation and using [StringBuilder][stringbuilder].
It takes some time to set up a `StringBuilder`.
When that time is divided by many multiple appends, the `StringBuilder` can be more efficient than concatenating.
For Raindrops, the most concatenations you'll have will be three.
So, while another solution is setting up the `StringBuilder` you can be well on your way to concatenating just three values.

For the [`Aggregate`][aggregate] method iterating on a [List][list], it takes so long to set up the `List` that the set up time for `StringBuilder`
has no significant impact on the performance.
Since the `Aggregate` approach  is about five times slower than the `if` statements approach,
the choice of concatenation or `StringBuilder` for `Aggregate` makes little difference anyway.

The `Aggregate` approach using an [Array][arrays] which is defined inline is over three times slower than the `if` statements approach.
That's better than being five times slower, but it is still significantly slower.

The `Aggregate` approach using an [Array][arrays] which is defined outside of the function as [readonly][readonly]
is just about three times slower than the `if` statements approach.
So even though the `Aggregate` approach with an `Array` is almost twice as fast as the `Aggregate` approach with a `List`,
it is still significantly slower than the `if` statements approach.
