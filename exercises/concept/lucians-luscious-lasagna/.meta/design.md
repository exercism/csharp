## Learning objectives

- Know what a variable is
- Know how to define a variable
- Know how to update a variable
- Know how to use type inference for variables
- Know how to define a method
- Know how to return a value from a method
- Know how to call a method
- Know that methods must be defined in classes
- Know about the `public` access modifier
- Know about the `static` modifier (only in the concept's `about.md`)

- Know how to use mathematical operators on integers
- Know how to define single- and multiline comments

## Out of scope

- Naming rules for identifiers
- Generic values

- Visibility

## Concepts

- `basics`: know what a variable is; know how to define a variable; know how to update a variable; know how to use type inference for variables; know how to define a method; know how to return a value from a method; know how to call a method; know that methods must be defined in classes; know about the `public` access modifier; know about the `static` modifier; know how to define an integer; know how to use mathematical operators on integers; know how to define single- and multiline comments. The following sub-concepts are included `type-inference`, `return-values`, `mutation`, `functions`, `comments`, `scoping`, `variables`

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites.

## Analyzer

This exercise could benefit from the following rules added to the [analyzer][analyzer]:

- Verify that the `RemainingMinutesInOven()` method calls the `ExpectedMinutesInOven()` method.
- Verify that the `ElapsedTimeInMinutes()` method calls the `PreparationTimeInMinutes()` method.
