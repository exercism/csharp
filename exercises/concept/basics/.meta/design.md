There are no prerequisites.

## Analyzer

This exercise could benefit from the following rules added to the the [analyzer][analyzer]:

- Verify that the `RemainingMinutesInOven()` method calls the `ExpectedMinutesInOven()` method.
- Verify that the `ElapsedTimeInMinutes()` method calls the `PreparationTimeInMinutes()` method.
