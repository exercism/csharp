# Instructions

You have been asked to improve some legacy code relating to a weather station.

The weather station accepts readings, and outputs some indicators such as temperature and pressure.

## 1. Improve the conciseness and readability of appropriate methods

Refactor any appropriate methods of the `WeatherStation` class using expression bodied members. Use ternary operations and switch expressions where appropriate to improve expressiveness and potentially reduce errors.

Ensure that all tests continue to pass.
