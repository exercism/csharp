# Hints

## General

- The bird count per day is stored in a [field][fields] named `birdsPerDay`.
- The bird count per day is an array that contains exactly 7 integers.

## 1. Check what the counts were last week

- As this method does _not_ depend on the current week's count, it is defined as a [`static` method][static-members].
- There are [several ways to define an array][single-dimensional-arrays].

## 2. Check how many birds visited today

- Remember that the counts are ordered by day from oldest to most recent, with the last element representing today.
- Accessing the last element can be done either by using its (fixed) index (remember to start counting from zero) or by calculating its index using the [array's size][array-length].

## 3. Increment today's count

- Set the element representing today's count to today's count plus 1.

## 4. Check if there was a day with no visiting birds

- The `Array` class has a [built-in method][array-indexof] that returns the first index where the element is found, or -1 if no matching element was found.

## 5. Calculate the number of visiting birds for the first number of days

- A variable can be used to hold the count for the number of visiting birds.
- The array can be iterated over using a [`for` loop][for-statement].
- The variable can be updated inside the loop.
- Remember: arrays are indexed from `0`.

## 6. Calculate the number of busy days

- A variable can be used to hold the number of busy days.
- The array can be iterated over using a [`foreach` loop][array-foreach].
- The variable can be updated inside the loop.
- A [conditional statement][if-statement] can be used inside the loop.
