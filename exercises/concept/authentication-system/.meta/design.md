# Design

## Learning objectives

- Know how to define `const` values.
- Know how to define `readonly` values.
- Know when to use `const` or `readonly`.
- know how to make a collection read-only
- understand the difference between the role of the `readonly` modifier and the use of read-only collections
- know how and when to use defensive copying

## Out of scope

- `readonly` structs
- `readonly` properties
- `ref readonly`

## Concepts

- `constants`: know how to define `const` values; know how to define `readonly` modifier know when to use `const` or `readonly`.
- `readonly-collections`: know how to make a collection read-only; understand the difference between the role of the `readonly` modifier and the use of readonly collections
- `defensive-copying`: know how and when to use defensive copying

## Prerequisites

- `classes`: know how to define fields.
- `basics`: know how to define variables.
- `object-initializers`: part of the provided code
- `arrays`: referred to in _about.md_
- `properties`: understand how accessors are independent of each other
- `dictionaries`: understand the syntax and semantics of dictionaries (incl. in code)
- `nested-types`: understand the syntax of semantics nested types (incl. in code)
