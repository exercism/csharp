# Hints

## 1. Create a new dictionary

A dictionary is like any other class. You simply 'new' it to create an empty instance.

## 2. Create a pre-populated dictionary

Although it's possible to populate a dictionary by repeatedly adding items, dictionaries can be initialized statically.

See [this article][dictionary_static_initialization].

## 3. Add a country to an empty dictionary

See [Add][dictionary_add]. Pass in the dictionary returned by task 1 as a parameter.

## 4. Add a country to an existing dictionary

There is no substantial difference between adding an item to an empty or initialized dictionary. Pass in the dictionary returned by task 2 as a parameter.

## 5. Get the country name matching a country Code

See [this article][dictionary_item].

## 6. Attempt to get country name for a non-existent country code

You need to [detect][dictionary_contains_key] whether the country is present in the dictionary.

## 7. Attempt to get country name for a non-existent country code

You can combine what you've learnt in Tasks 5 and 6 to solve this one.

## 8. Update a country name

Again [this article][dictionary_item] applies.

## 9. Attempt to ypdate name of country that is not in the dictionary

This is very similar to task 7.

## 10. Remove a country from the dictionary

See [this article][dictionary_remove].

## 11. Find the country with the longest name

See the [values collection][dictionary_values], [string length][string_length] and [foreach][foreach].
