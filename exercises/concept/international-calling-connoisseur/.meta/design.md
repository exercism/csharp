## Learning objectives

- Know of the existence of the `Dictionary<TKey, TElement>` type.
- Know how to define a dictionary.
- Know how to add and updated elements in a dictionary.
- Know how to access elements in a dictionary by key.
- Know how to iterate over elements in a dictionary.
- Know some basic dictionary functions (like checking if a key exists).

## Out of scope

- Generic functions.
- Generic constraints.
- Memory and performance characteristics.
- LINQ.
- Concurrency issues.
- Co-/contravariance.
- Equality.
- The `Lookup<TKey, TElement>` type.

## Concepts

- `dictionaries`: know of the existence of the `Dictionary<TKey, TElement>` type; know how to define a dictionary; know how to add and updated elements in a dictionary; know how to access elements in a dictionary by key; know how to iterate over elements in a dictionary; know some basic dictionary functions.
- `base-class-library`: know of the existence and role of the base class library

## Prerequisites

- `foreach-loops`: know how to use a `foreach-loop` to iterate over a collection.
- `generic-types`: know how generic types work.
- `strings`: know how to discover string length
- `indexers`: usage and behavior of indexer properties
- `object-initializers`: how object initializers are used with collections.
