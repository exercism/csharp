## Learning objectives

- Know of the existence of the three floating point types: `double`, `float` and `decimal`.
- Know when to use which floating point type.
- Know how to write a `while` loop.
- know how to write a `do` loop.

## Out of scope

- Parsing floating-point types from strings.
- Converting floating-point types to strings.
- Using standard or custom format strings.

## Concepts

- `floating-point-numbers`: know of the existing of the three floating point types: `double`, `float` and `decimal`. know when to use which floating point type.
- `while-loops`: know how to write a `while` loop.
- `do-while-loops`: know the syntax of `do` loop; know when to use a `do` loop

## Prerequisites

This exercise's prerequisites Concepts are:

- `numbers`: define numbers and apply arithmetic and boolean logic to them.
- `conditionals`: conditionally execute code based on value of floating-point numbers.
- `if-statements`:
