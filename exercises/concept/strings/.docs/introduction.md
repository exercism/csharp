# Introduction

A `string` in C# is an object that represents immutable text as a sequence of Unicode characters (letters, digits, punctuation, etc.). Strings are manipulated by calling the string's methods. Once a string has been constructed, its value can never change. Any methods that appear to modify a string will actually return a new string.
