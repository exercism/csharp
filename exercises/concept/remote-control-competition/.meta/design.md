# Design

## Learning objectives

- Know what interfaces are.
- Know how to use interfaces.
- Know how to define an interface.
- Know how to explicitly implement an interface (discussion only).
- Default interface implementations (discussion only).

## Out of scope

## Concepts

- `interfaces`: know what interfaces are; know how to use interfaces; know how to define an interface; know how to implement an interface; know how to explicitly implement an interface.
- `ordering` : know how to implement the `IComparable<T>` interface and what its effect is on the behavior of collections.
- `explicit-interfaces`: know how an explicit interface is declared; know how use an explicit interface; know why explicit interfaces are useful

## Prerequisites

- `classes`: know how to work with classes.
- `properties`: know what properties are.
- `lists`: know how to use `List<T>`.
