# Design

## Learning objectives

- Know what generic types are.
- Know of the existence of the `List<T>` type.
- Know how a list is different from an array.
- Know how to define a list.
- Know how to add and remove elements from a list.
- Know how to access elements in a list by their index.
- Know how to iterate over elements in a list.
- Know some basic list functions (like finding the index of an element in a list or sorting a list).

## Out of scope

- Generic functions.
- Generic constraints.
- Memory and performance characteristics.
- LINQ.
- Concurrency issues.
- Co-/contravariance.
- Equality.
- List resizing due to it using an array as its data type.

## Concepts

- `lists`: know of the existence of the `List<T>` type; know how a list is different from an array; know how to define a list; know how to add and remove elements from a list; know how to access elements in a list by their index; know how to iterate over elements in a list; know some basic list functions (like finding the index of an element in a list).
- `generic-types`: know what generic types are.
- `collections`: know the role of collections in OO languages

## Prerequisites

- `for-loops`: know how to use a `for-loop` to iterate over a collection.
- `arrays`: contrast with dynamic nature of lists
