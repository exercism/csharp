# Introduction

## Equality

Simple types (strings and primitives) are typically tested for equality with the `==` and `!=`.

Reference types (Instances of classes) are compared using the `Equals()` method inherited from `Object`. If your goal with the equality test is to ensure that two objects are the exact same instance then relying on `Object`'s implementation will suffice. If not, you need to override `object.Equals()`.

If you know that all the instances of your class are created in one place, say characters in some game or simulation then reference equality is sufficient. However, it is likely that multiple instances of the same real-world entity will be created (from a database, by user input, via a web request). In this case values that uniquely identify the entity must be tested for equality. Therefore `Equals()` must be overridden and appropriate data members of your class are tested for equality.

An overridden `Equals()` method will contain equality tests on members of simple types using `==` and reference types with recursive calls to `Equals()`.

The `Object` class provides appropriate methods to compare two objects to detect if they are one and the same instance.

### `Object.GetHashCode()`

The `Object.GetHashCode()` method returns a hash code in the form of a 32 bit integer. The hash code is used by _dictionary_ and _set_ classes such as `Dictionary<T>` and `HashSet<T>`to store and retrieve objects in a performant manner.

The relationship between hash code and equality is that if two objects are equal (`Equal()` returns true) then `GetHashCode()` for the two objects must return the same value. This does not apply in the reverse direction. It is not symmetrical. Just because two objects have the same hashcode they do not have to be equal. Picture a lookup function that first goes to a "bucket" based on the hash code and then picks out the particular item using the equality test.

The HashCode library API documentation discusses the best way to generate a hash code

The values used in the equality test must be stable while the hashed collection is in use. If you add an object to the collection with one set of values and then change those values the hash code will no longer point to the correct "bucket". In practice this means that the object should be immutable. Other approaches run the risk of creating gotchas for maintainers.

## Sets

The `HashSet` library class provides a good mechanism for storing unique values.
