# Design

## Learning objectives

- Explain integral number overflows.
- Explain floating-point number overflows.
- Know how to use `checked` and `unchecked` to deal with overflows.

## Out of scope

## Concepts

- `overflow`: explain integral number overflows; explain floating-point number overflows; know how to use `checked` and `unchecked` to deal with overflows.

## Prerequisites

- `integral-numbers`: know about the integral number types.
- `floating-point-numbers`: know about the floating-point number types.
- `exceptions`: explain how an `OverflowException` is thrown when using checked arithmetic.
- `strings`: numbers are converted to strings.
