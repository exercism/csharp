## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student the Concept of Exceptions in C#.

## Learning objectives

- Know what exceptions are.
- Know when an exception should be thrown.
- Know how to throw (and rethrow) an exception.
- Know how to catch an exception.
- Know the most important built-in exceptions (`ArgumentException`, `InvalidOperationException`).

## Out of scope

- Exception filters.
- User-defined exceptions.
- try/finally blocks.
- Memory and performance characteristics.
- Overflows.

## Concepts

- `exceptions`: know what exceptions are; know when an exception should be thrown; know how to throw (and rethrow) an exception; know how to catch an exception; know the most important built-in exceptions (`ArgumentException`, `InvalidOperationException`).

## Prerequisites

- `inheritance`: know about class hierarchies
- `nullability`: know what `null` is
- `switch-statements`: know how to write a `switch` statement
