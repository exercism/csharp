# Design

## Learning objectives

- Know how to clean up resources using `IDisposable` in C# for managed resources.
- Know how and when to implement the `IDisposable` interface on your own classes.

## Out of scope

- resource lifetime - `using` dealt with in the `resource-lifetime` exercise
- dispose pattern: handled in a separate exercise

## Concepts

- `resource-cleanup`: Know how to clean up resources with `IDisposable` in C# and .NET. Understand the difference between managed and unmanaged resources and the role of `IDisposable`.

## Prerequisites

- `exceptions`
