## Learning objectives

- Know of the difference between signed and unsigned integral types.
- Know of the existence of the integral types: `sbyte`, `byte`, `short`, `ushort`, `int`, `uint`, `long` and `ulong`.
- Know when to use which integral type.

## Out of scope

- BigInteger.
- Overflows.
- Nullable integral types.

## Concepts

- `integral-numbers`: know of the difference between signed and unsigned integral types; know of the existence of the integral types: `sbyte`, `byte`, `short`, `ushort`, `int`, `uint`, `long` and `ulong`; know when to use which integral type.
- `unsigned-integers`: know the characteristics of unsigned integers

## Prerequisites

- `numbers`: define numbers and apply arithmetic and logic to them.
- `arrays`: byte array is used in the exercises.
- `casting`: Understand casting of integral numeric types.
