# Design

## Learning objectives

- Know what structs are.
- Know how to define a `struct`.
- Know how to add members to structs.
- Know the differences between structs and classes.

## Out of scope

- ref structs.
- ref returns
- ref locals
- readonly structs
- Struct finalizers.
- `Span<T>`/`Memory<T>`
- `stackalloc`

## Concepts

This Concepts Exercise's Concepts are:

- `structs`: know xx what structs are; know how to define a `struct`; know how to add members to structs; know the differences between structs and classes.

## Prerequisites

- `inheritance`: know that all types are derived from `object`.
- `classes`: know how to define and work with classes.
- `numbers`:
- `sets`: know how to define and work with a `HashSet`
- `signed-integers`/`integral-numbers`: for `ushort`
