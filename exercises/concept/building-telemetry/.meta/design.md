# Design

## Learning objectives

- Know the difference between value and reference type parameters.
- Know how to pass value types by reference using the `ref` and `out` modifiers.

## Out of scope

- Overload resolution.
- ref returns.
- ref locals.
- `in` modifier

## Concepts

- `parameters`: know the difference between value and reference type parameters; know how to pass value types by reference using the `ref` and `out` modifiers.
- `out-parameters`: know the syntax of `out` parameters; know the role of `out` parameters
- `optional-arguments`: know the syntax and behavior or optional arguments

## Prerequisites

- `if-statements`: `if`, `else`
- `numbers`
- `strings`
- `constructors`: the exercise provides a gentle intuitive introduction to simple parameters
- `named-arguments`: introduced in the `method-overloading` exercise and used here in _instructions.md_.
