# Introduction

A property in C# is a member of a class that provides access to data within that class.
Callers can set or retrieve (get) the data. Properties can be either auto-implemented or
have a backing field. They comprise a set accessor and/or a get accessor.
In some other languages a "mutator" is roughly equivalent to a
a set accessor and an "accessor" is roughly equivalent to a set accessor although
the composition of the syntax is completely different.

When setting a property the input value can be validated, formatted
or otherwise manipulated and in fact any programmatic operation accessible to code in the
class can be executed.

Similarly when retrieving a property data can be calculated or formatted and again
any programmatic operation available to the class can be executed.

Properties have access modifiers (`public`, `private` etc.) in the same way as other
class members but the set accessor may have an access level independent of the retrieve (get)
accessor and vice versa. A property doesn't have to have both accessors, it can have just one (either get or set).

The basic syntax to express properties can take two forms:

## Field/Expression Backed Properties:

```csharp
private int myField;
public int MyProperty
{
    get { return myfField; }
    set { myField = value; }
}
```

## Auto-implemented Properties

```
public int MyProperty { get; private set; } = 42;
```

Initialization is optional.
