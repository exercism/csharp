# Hints

## 1. Describe a character

- Modify the [constructors][constructor-syntax] of the `Wizard` and `Warrior` classes to pass their character type to the [base class' constructor][instance-constructors].
- Store the character type as a [field][fields] on the `Character` class.
- The `Character` class implicitly inherits from the `object` class, which [`ToString()` method you can override][override-tostring].

## 2. Make characters not vulnerable by default

- Implement the `Vulnerable()` method in the `Character` class to always return `false`.

## 3. Allow Wizards to prepare a spell

- Add a field to the `Wizard` class to store if a spell was prepared and update this in the `PrepareSpell()` method.
- The spell should start out as not being prepared.

## 4. Make Wizards vulnerable when not having prepared a spell

- Override the `Vulnerable()` method in the `Wizard` class to make Wizards vulnerable if they haven't prepared a spell.

## 5. Calculate the damage points for a Wizard

- Use a [conditional statement][if-else] to return the the damage points, taking into account the value of the prepare spell field.

## 6. Calculate the damage points for a Warrior

- You can call a method on the passed `Character` instance to determine its vulnerability.
- Use a [conditional statement][if-else] to return the the damage points, taking into account the vulnerability of the target.
