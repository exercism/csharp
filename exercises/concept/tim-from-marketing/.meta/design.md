# Design

## Learning objectives

- Know of the existence of the `null` literal.
- Know what a `NullReferenceException` is and when it is thrown.
- Know how to compare a value to `null`.
- Know the difference between value and reference types regarding nullability, especially pre C# 8.0.
- Know how to define nullable reference and value types.
- Know about the null-related operators (`!`, `?`, `??`).
- Know about basic null checking by the compiler.

## Out of scope

- Nullable attributes.
- In-depth discussion of null checking by the compiler.
- Enabling C# 8 null checking.
- Casting using the `as` or `is` operator or using pattern matching.

## Concepts

- `nullability`: know of the existence of the `null` literal; know what a `NullReferenceException` is and when it is thrown; know how to compare a value to `null`; know the difference between value and reference types regarding nullability; know how to define nullable reference and value types; know about the null-related operators; know about basic null checking by the compiler.
- `null-coalescing`: know the syntax and behavior of the null-coalescing operator (??)
- `null-conditional`: know the syntax and behavior of the null-conditional operator (?.)
- `null-forgiving`: know the syntax and behavior of the null-forgiving operator (!.); know to use the operator with discretion
- `nullable-values`: know about nullable primitives; know about nullable structs

## Prerequisites

- `strings`: strings will be compared to `null` and basic methods from strings will be called.
- `basics`: integers will be compared to `null`, arithmetic operations will be performed on integers, variables will be introduced and updated.
- `if-statements`: using a conditional statement.
- `memory-allocation`: reference and value types will be used in their nullable and non-nullable variants.
