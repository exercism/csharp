# Design

## Learning objectives

- Know how to implement randomness with `System.Random` in C#.
- Know that no seed is required
- Know that both integers and real numbers can be generated
- Know that once generated random numbers can be easily used for many purposes (including non-numeric ones).
- Know about thread safety and how it relates to the `System.Random` class (discussion only).

## Out of scope

- Secure random numbers

## Concepts

- `randomness`: know how to implement randomness with `System.Random` in C#; know that no seed is required; know that both integers and real numbers can be generated; know that once generated random numbers can be easily used for many purposes (including non-numeric ones)

## Prerequisites

- `numbers`
