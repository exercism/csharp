# Instructions

Continuing the theme of the wizards and warriors game, it is time to add an all purpose die rolling method. This will be the traditional 18 sided die with numbers 1 to 18. Players also generate a spell strength.

## 1. Enable a _wizards and warriors_ player to roll a die.

Implement a `RollDie()` method on the `Player` class.

```csharp
var player = new Player();
player.RollDie();
// => >= 1 <= 18
```

## 2. Players need their strength. Provide a means to generate spell strength

Implement a `GenerateSpellStregngth()` method on the player class. The spell strength is between 0.0 and 100.0.

Note that spell strength must be a real number (not an integer) to reduce the possibility of a tie when the strengths of two adversaries are compared.

```csharp
var player = new Player();
player.GenerateSpellStrength();
// => >= 0.0 < 100.0
```
