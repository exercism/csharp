## Learning objectives

- Know what explicit and implicit casts are.
- Know how to do an explicit cast.
- Know how to use `is` and `as` to cast types.
- Know how to use the `typeof` operator.
- Pattern matching on types.

## Out of scope

- Custom explicit and implicit cast operators.
- Memory and performance characteristics.

## Concepts

- `casting`: know what explicit and implicit casts are; know how to do an explicit cast; know how to use `is` and `as` to convert between types.
- `implicit-casting`: know about implicit type conversion

## Prerequisites

- `numbers`: know how to cast numbers and what explicit and implicit numeric casts are.
- `inheritance`: work with inheritance to show when casting can be reasonably used.
- `exceptions`: know about exceptions to understand what happens when an explicit cast fails.
