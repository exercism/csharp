# Hints

## General

- [using statement][using-statement] documentation describes how and when to use the `using` keyword.

## 1. Write to the database

- Consider the various methods on the database, and the states that the database transitions to with each one.

## 2. Write to the database and return an indication to the caller of whether the write operation was successful

- Use of [`exceptions`][try-catch] is necessary in this case.
