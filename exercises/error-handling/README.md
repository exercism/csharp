# Error Handling

Implement various kinds of error handling and resource management.

An important point of programming is how to handle errors and close
resources even if errors occur.

This exercise requires you to handle various errors. Because error handling
is rather programming language specific you'll have to refer to the tests
for your track to see what's exactly required.

## Running the tests

To run the tests, run the command `dotnet test` from within the exercise directory.

Initially, only the first test will be enabled. This is to encourage you to solve the exercise one step at a time.
Once you get the first test passing, remove the `Skip` property from the next test and work on getting that test passing.
Once none of the tests are skipped and they are all passing, you can submit your solution 
using `exercism submit ErrorHandling.cs`
