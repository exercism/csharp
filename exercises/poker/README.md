# Poker

Pick the best hand(s) from a list of poker hands.

See [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poker_hands) for an
overview of poker hands.

## Running the tests

To run the tests, run the command `dotnet test` from within the exercise directory.

Initially, only the first test will be enabled. This is to encourage you to solve the exercise one step at a time.
Once you get the first test passing, remove the `Skip` property from the next test and work on getting that test passing.
Once none of the tests are skipped and they are all passing, you can submit your solution 
using `exercism submit Poker.cs`
