# Pythagorean Triplet

A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, {a, b, c}, for
which,

```text
a**2 + b**2 = c**2
```

and such that,

```text
a < b < c
```

For example,

```text
3**2 + 4**2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5**2.
```

There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.

Find the product a * b * c.
